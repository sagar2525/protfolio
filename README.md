# Sagar Singh Kushwaha  Portfolio

A dark, minimal, and responsive personal portfolio for **Sagar Singh Kushwaha**, focused on Python, AI, and backend automation.

## Structure

- `index.html`  main page
- `styles.css`  layout, dark theme, animations
- `script.js`  smooth scroll, project modal, contact form UX
- `assets/`  place your profile photo and resume here (see below)

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` directly in your browser or use a lightweight dev server.

### On Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\sagar\Desktop\protfolio"
start index.html
```

Or with a simple Python server:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\sagar\Desktop\protfolio"
python -m http.server 5500
```

Then visit: <http://localhost:5500>.

## Customization

- **Profile image**: replace the `src` of the avatar in `index.html` with your own image path (for example `assets/profile.jpg`).
- **Resume button**: put your PDF at `assets/Sagar_Singh_Kushwaha_Resume.pdf` or update the `href` in the Resume section.
- **Social links**: update GitHub, LinkedIn, and email URLs in the hero social icons.

Use this as a base and extend sections (e.g., more projects, blog posts) as your work grows.
